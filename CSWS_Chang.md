# Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation

## Notes
p. 111: "But invisibility was it's own kind of reward; it meant you had to answer to no one except the other who shared your condition. It meant you became obsessed with showing and proving, distinguishing yourself and your originality above the crowd. It put you on a relentless quest to prove to them that you were bigger, wilder, and bolder than circumstances dictated you should ever be, to try to generate something from nothing, something no one else had, until everyone around you had to admit that you had something they might necer have, somehting taht might eveen make other people -- big, important people -- stand up and take notice themselves, offer you money, give you power, or try to crush your every soul. That was the key to having style."
